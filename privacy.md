excerpt: "Privacy Policy"
---

<h5>Effective Date: Nov 4, 2016</h5>

This Privacy Policy describes Requestly's information practices for its website and browser extension. 
We take your privacy seriously and want you to understand exactly what information we collect, 
how we use that information, which pieces of information you can request us to remove, and how to contact us about this policy. 
Please read this policy carefully. 
Your continued use of the Requestly extension and/or the Requestly website constitutes your agreement to this policy.
When it comes to your personal information, most of this policy applies to users 
who choose to share your rules as public Urls or who donate to support Requestly. 

#### Information Requestly collects

*Personal information*

The Requestly browser extension stores your name and email address on secured Firebase servers only when you authenticate 
with Google. Your public rules are also saved securely on Firebase servers. Non-public rules are saved in Chrome Storage.
However Requestly website does not collect any sort of personal information.

*Anonymous information*

The Requestly extension captures anonymous usage information, including but not limited to: current version of the extension, 
creation, modification and deletion of rule. We just capture an event like "Redirect Rule created"
but we do not capture what is the definition of rule. Along with this, Requestly tend to capture some pixels used on various websites.
Please note all such data is captures anonymously and no user level data is gathered.

*Analytics*

Requestly uses Google analytics services to aggregate information about traffic patterns and how our website and extension are used. 
We limit the data sent to these services, and only do so to improve our extension and website. 
Requestly currently uses Google Analytics (privacy policy [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245)).

#### Data security
As mentioned earlier, Shared rules are stored on Firebase secured server 
(privacy policy [here](https://www.firebase.com/terms/privacy-policy.html).
All your rules live in `Chrome Sync Storage` on your machine and Requestly does not (and can not) play any role in safeguarding your rules.
All usage information that Requestly collects is stored on Google servers as collected by Google Analytics. 
That said, no database or server is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data in our system or while being transmitted over the Internet. 
Our best effort is given, but you use Requestly's website and browser extension at your own risk.

#### Changes and updates to this policy
Requestly reserves the right to change this policy for any reason, and may make small, inconsequential changes to this policy with or without notice. 
Each time this policy is changed we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of this page.
