Dear Comedy world fans,
Thanks for being a part of Requestly userbase. I am writing this blogpost to clarify a few things about Requestly and its usage.
Recently, I have been following a few tweets and other social media posts about using Requestly to bring back comedy world theme back on
goAnimate. I have also received few emails and questions on Chrome store asking help to bring back the popular theme. However, I want to
clarify that Requestly doesn't recommend or appreciate the users to manipulate a certain website without the website owner's will.
Still, If you want to do something like this, do this at your own risk.

## What is Requestly ?
Requestly is a chrome and firefox extension which allows users to modify network requests.
Requestly was mainly developed for web developers to

- Debug their javascripts running in production environment
- Fixing Css style bugs
- Fixing Image and other Urls on their browser
- Creating URL shortcuts
- Blocking unnecessary time killing websites

However, I have seen poeple using Requestly for various other innovative use cases.

## Is Requestly a hacking software ?

No, Requestly is not a hacking software. Requestly only manipulates the requests on your computer.
Website on which rules are evaluated will be unaffacted for other users.

## Request to all as Requestly owner

- Please avoid leaving negative rating on chrome store just because you are not able to bring back Comedy world theme.
Please search the internet and ask for help on other forums. I myself don't know how to bring back comedy world theme back.
- Please do not spread negative things about Requestly like Requestly is a hacking software. Now you know it isn't.
- Please use Requestly for constructive and innovative purposes.

## Last few words..

Once again, I thank all of you for using Requestly. I hope you will continue using it and take your learning to the next level.
And No, Alving Hung is not going to destroy Requestly and he did not contact me to write this article. I just wrote this to
contact you guys and tell you about Requestly.
